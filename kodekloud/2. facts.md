### Ansible Facts: Detailed Notes

#### 1. What are Ansible Facts?
- **Ansible Facts** are pieces of system information that Ansible automatically gathers from remote nodes when it connects to them.
- These facts include details about the system's hardware, network configuration, operating system, installed software, and more.

#### 2. Why Do We Need Ansible Facts?
- **Dynamic Inventory Management:** Helps in categorizing and managing hosts based on their attributes.
- **Conditional Task Execution:** Enables tasks to be executed only when certain conditions are met, improving automation precision.
- **Customized Configurations:** Allows configuration files and services to be tailored based on the specific details of the system.

#### 3. What Module Does Ansible Use to Gather Facts?
- Ansible uses the **`setup`** module to gather facts.
- This module collects a comprehensive set of details from the target system, such as hardware information, network settings, and OS details.

#### 4. How to Print Facts on the Terminal? (Example YAML File)
```yaml
---
- name: Gather and print facts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts
      setup:

    - name: Print all facts
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts
```

#### 5. Use Cases of Ansible Facts
- **Dynamic Task Execution:** Running tasks conditionally based on system attributes, such as installing software only on certain OS types.
- **Inventory Categorization:** Grouping hosts dynamically based on gathered facts, like separating servers by their operating system.
- **Configuration Management:** Customizing configuration files and service parameters based on specific system information.
- **System Auditing:** Collecting detailed system information for inventory and compliance purposes.

#### 6. How to Disable Fact Gathering in Ansible?
- You can disable automatic fact gathering in a playbook to speed up execution if the facts are not needed.
```yaml
---
- name: Play without fact gathering
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Print message
      debug:
        msg: "Facts not gathered for this play."
```

#### 7. Where to Define Fact Gathering in `ansible.cfg`?
- Fact gathering settings can be adjusted in the `ansible.cfg` configuration file under the `[defaults]` section.
- To disable fact gathering globally:
```ini
[defaults]
gather_facts = False
```
- To specify a subset of facts to gather:
```ini
[defaults]
gathering = smart
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = /tmp/facts_cache
```

### Summary
- **Ansible Facts** provide crucial system information gathered by the `setup` module.
- These facts enable dynamic, conditional, and customized task execution.
- They can be printed using a playbook with the `debug` module and can be disabled or tailored through playbook settings or `ansible.cfg`.
