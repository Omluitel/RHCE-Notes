### Ansible Force Handlers - Step-by-Step Class Notes

#### Introduction to Handlers
- **Handlers** are special tasks in Ansible that are run only when notified by other tasks.
- They are typically used for actions like restarting services after configuration changes.
- Handlers are defined in a separate section and are triggered using the `notify` directive.

#### Problem: Task Failures and Handlers
- Normally, if a playbook fails before a handler is triggered, the handler will not run.
- This can be problematic if you need certain actions (like cleaning up or restarting a service) to always happen, even if a failure occurs.

#### Solution: Force Handlers
- **Force Handlers** ensure that handlers are executed even if a failure occurs before they are normally triggered.
- This is done by setting `force_handlers: true` at the playbook level.

#### Step-by-Step Example

**Step 1: Setting Up the Playbook**

1. **Define the Playbook:**
   - Start by defining a playbook targeting your hosts.

2. **Set `force_handlers` to `true`:**
   - Add the directive `force_handlers: true` to ensure handlers run even after a failure.

```yaml
- name: Example playbook with force handlers
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  force_handlers: true
```

**Step 2: Define Variables (Optional)**
- Define any variables you might need. For example, to specify a package name:

```yaml
  vars:
    package_name: "nginx"
```

**Step 3: Create Tasks**

1. **Install a Package:**
   - Use the `apt` module to install a package and notify a handler if the task changes the state.

```yaml
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
      notify:
        - Restart nginx
```

2. **Create a Configuration File:**
   - Use the `copy` module to create or update a configuration file and notify a handler.

```yaml
    - name: Create configuration file
      copy:
        content: |
          server {
              listen 80;
              server_name localhost;
          }
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      notify:
        - Restart nginx
```

3. **Simulate a Failure:**
   - Include a task that is designed to fail to test the force handlers.

```yaml
    - name: Fail intentionally
      command: /bin/false
```

**Step 4: Define Handlers**

- Handlers are defined at the same level as tasks and are triggered by the `notify` directive in tasks.

```yaml
  handlers:
    - name: Restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

**Full Example Playbook**

```yaml
- name: Example playbook with force handlers
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  force_handlers: true

  vars:
    package_name: "nginx"

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
      notify:
        - Restart nginx

    - name: Create configuration file
      copy:
        content: |
          server {
              listen 80;
              server_name localhost;
          }
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      notify:
        - Restart nginx

    - name: Fail intentionally
      command: /bin/false

  handlers:
    - name: Restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

#### Summary

1. **Handlers** are used to perform actions like restarting services when certain tasks notify them.
2. **Force Handlers** ensure these critical actions run even if a failure occurs in the playbook.
3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Define the playbook and set `force_handlers: true`.
   - Create tasks and use the `notify` directive to link them to handlers.
   - Define handlers to perform necessary actions.
4. **Test with Failure:** Include a failing task to ensure force handlers work as expected.
