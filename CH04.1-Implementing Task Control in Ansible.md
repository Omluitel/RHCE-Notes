### Implementing Task Control in Ansible

## Goals:
- Manage task control
- Use handlers
- Handle task errors in Ansible playbooks

## Loops in Ansible

Loops allow you to execute a task multiple times with different variables or items. This is useful for tasks such as installing multiple packages, creating multiple users, or processing a list of items.

### Use Cases of Loops in Ansible:
1. Installing multiple packages
2. Creating multiple users
3. Managing multiple files
4. Running commands with different arguments
5. Setting multiple environment variables
6. Creating multiple directories
7. Managing multiple services
8. Adding multiple lines to configuration files
9. Creating multiple network interfaces
10. Managing multiple cron jobs
11. Assigning multiple roles to users
12. Deploying multiple applications
13. Uploading multiple templates
14. Restarting multiple services
15. Configuring multiple firewall rules

### Example Playbook Using Loops

```yaml
---
- name: Ansible Loops Examples
  hosts: all
  tasks:

    # Install multiple packages using a simple loop with a list of items
    - name: Install multiple packages
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop: 
        - httpd
        - nginx
        - mariadb-server

    # Create multiple users using a loop with a list of dictionaries
    - name: Create multiple users
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        state: present
        uid: "{{ item.uid }}"
      loop: 
        - { name: 'alice', uid: 1001 }
        - { name: 'bob', uid: 1002 }

    # Print each item in a loop along with its index
    - name: Print item and its index
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Item {{ item }} is at index {{ ansible_loop.index }}"
      loop: 
        - one
        - two
        - three

    # Create directories using nested loops
    - name: Create directories with nested loops
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "/var/www/{{ item.0 }}/{{ item.1 }}"
        state: directory
      with_nested: 
        - [ 'site1', 'site2' ]
        - [ 'logs', 'public' ]

    # Print each item with a custom label using loop control
    - name: Print item with custom label
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Processing {{ item }}"
      loop: 
        - alpha
        - beta
        - gamma
      loop_control:
        label: "{{ item }} item"

    # Install packages conditionally based on the OS family
    - name: Install selected packages based on condition
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop: 
        - vim
        - nano
        - emacs
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

### What is `item` in Ansible?

In Ansible, `item` is a special variable used within a loop to represent the current element being processed in the iteration. Ansible automatically assigns the current element of the loop to the `item` variable, allowing you to reference the loop element dynamically within the task.

---

## Running Tasks Conditionally

In Ansible, you can run tasks conditionally using the `when` keyword. This allows you to specify conditions that must be met for a task to execute. Conditions can be based on variables, facts, or the results of previous tasks.

### Basic Syntax

The `when` keyword is followed by an expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the task is executed; otherwise, it is skipped.

### Example 1: Conditional Task Based on a Variable

```yaml
- name: Install nginx only if webserver variable is true
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: webserver
```

### Example 2: Conditional Task Based on the Operating System

```yaml
- name: Update package cache on Debian-based systems
  apt:
    update_cache: yes
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

### Example 3: Conditional Task Based on the Existence of a File

```yaml
- name: Create a file if it doesn't exist
  file:
    path: /tmp/example.txt
    state: touch
  when: not ansible_facts['ansible_facts'].get('ansible_local', {}).get('example', {}).get('exists', False)
```

### Example 4: Conditional Task Based on the Output of a Previous Task

```yaml
- name: Check if the service is running
  shell: systemctl is-active my_service
  register: service_status
  ignore_errors: true

- name: Restart the service if it is not running
  service:
    name: my_service
    state: restarted
  when: service_status.rc != 0
```

### Example 5: Conditional Task Based on a Specific Date or Time

```yaml
- name: Run task only on weekdays
  shell: echo "Today is a weekday"
  when: ansible_date_time.weekday in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
```

### Example 6: Conditional Task Based on a Condition Involving Multiple Variables

```yaml
- name: Perform action if both conditions are met
  debug:
    msg: "Both conditions are true"
  when: var1 == 'value1' and var2 == 'value2'
```

### Example 7: Conditional Task Based on Host-Specific Variables

```yaml
- name: Execute task only on specific hosts
  debug:
    msg: "This is a database server"
  when: "'database' in group_names"
```

### Summary

- **Syntax**: Use `when` followed by a condition.
- **Variables**: Conditions can be based on variables, facts, or registered results.
- **Logical Operators**: Combine conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- **Flexibility**: Conditions provide flexibility to control task execution based on dynamic criteria.

## Ensuring Service Availability: Check, Install, Enable, and Start `httpd` Service

This Ansible playbook ensures that the `httpd` (Apache HTTP Server) is installed, enabled, and started on the target hosts.

```yaml
---
- name: Check, install, enable, and start httpd service
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check if httpd is installed
      command: rpm -q httpd
      register: httpd_installed
      ignore_errors: true

    - name: Install httpd if not installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: httpd_installed.rc != 0

    - name: Enable and start httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

## Handlers in Ansible

In Ansible, handlers are tasks that are triggered by other tasks when specific conditions are met. They are typically used to restart services or perform other actions that should only occur when configuration changes require them.

### Example Playbook with Handlers

```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with Handlers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Update package cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```

### Use Cases of Handlers

Here are some common use cases for handlers in Ansible:

- **Service Restart**: Restart services after configuration changes to apply the new settings.
- **Configuration File Updates**: Reload or restart services when configuration files are updated.
- **Package Installation**: Restart services after installing or updating packages.
- **Security Updates**: Restart services to apply security updates.
- **Application Deployment**: Restart application servers or clear cache after deploying new versions.
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Trigger actions like server reboots after provisioning new infrastructure.
- **Monitoring Configuration**: Reload monitoring agents or restart services after updating configurations.
- **Database Maintenance**: Restart database services or perform backups after making changes.
- **Rollback Operations**: Rollback changes by restarting services or reverting configurations if a deployment fails.
- **Custom Maintenance Tasks**: Trigger custom tasks like clearing cache or running health checks.

### Example Playbook with Multiple Handlers

```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with Handlers
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Update index.html
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Restart MySQL service
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: restarted
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
      notify: Notify Admin

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted

    - name: Notify Admin
      mail:
        to: admin@example.com
        subject: "MySQL service restarted"
        body: "The MySQL service has been restarted on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
```
